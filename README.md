## About me
Iâ€™m a positive, enthusiastic and competent Software
Developer, over the years, has built up a diverse
range of skills, qualities and attributes that makes
me a high performer is this field.

I have extensive experience working both alone and
as part of a team on often time-sensitive,
challenging web development and projects that
require outstanding creative and technical
capabilities and the ability to ensure all work is
optimized across a wide range of platforms.

I take my work as software developer seriously and
this means I always ensure my skills are kept up to
date within this rapidly changing industry
Currently Iâ€™m looking for a new opportunity to take
my skills to the next level
